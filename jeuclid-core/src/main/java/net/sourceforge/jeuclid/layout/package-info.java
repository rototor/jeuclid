 * The classes in this package provide a generic  method for layouting of 
 * displayable objects. A node to be layouted must implement the 
 * {@link LayoutableNode} 
 * interface. The layout functions will then generate instances of
 * {@link GraphicsObject}. These can be drawn when the layout is completed.
