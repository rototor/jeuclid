<section><title>History</title><para>This project started as a subproject from BMBF
project(www.vs-c.de) in germany. One of the big problems from HTML
is, that it isn't possible to display mathematical equations in the
browser. Since MathML initiative started at w3 consortium, it is
possible to store mathematical formulas in XML documents, but there
isn't a easy and cheap way to display this formulas. So this
projoct launched with the destination to fill this gap.</para><para>The project started as a component for the Apache Cocoon
project(xml.apache.org). This component converted MathML documents
to GIF images or SVG. So the user could easy write documents with
embedding MathML fragments, and the component create in situ the
GIF images. The SVG converter was used to create documents with
embedding SVG fragments for e.g. the FOP to create PDF, or what
else, documents.</para><para>After being dormant for some time, the project was picked up
again by Max in the summer of 2006. It has since then shifted its
focus, away from a cocoon componet to a more generic MathML
solution.</para></section>
